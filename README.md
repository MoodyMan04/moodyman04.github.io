# Personal Website

This project is for my personal website hosted at:

### https://moodyman04.github.io/

The website is styled like an old CRT computer, and includes links to my professional information and some fun stuff!

#### Credits:

This website would not be possible without help without:

- BowlBird at https://github.com/BowlBird for CRT filter help.

- Minisodan at https://github.com/minisodan for GitHub API help.

And all my friends from NDSU's ACM 2022-2025!

Also thanks to:

- Kaisermann at https://github.com/kaisermann
  for inspiration for the website.

Thank you all!
