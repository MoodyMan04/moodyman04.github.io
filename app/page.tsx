              Hello! My name is Gunnar Moody! I am a dedicated software engineer
              and current student of NDSU&#39;s class of 2025, where I am
              pursuing a bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science with an
              interest in Cybersecurity and a minor in A.I.
              <br className="small-br" />
              <br className="small-br" />
              While at NDSU, I have gained experience through many different
              projects, including school team projects and working as a game
              developer on our ACM&#39;s Byte-le Royale 2024-25!
              <br className="small-br" />
              <br className="small-br" />I am currently working for Fast
              Enterprises over the summer as a Implementation Intern with the
              Colorado Tax team!
              <br className="small-br" />
              <br className="small-br" />I love to learn and find everything
              computers fascinating! When I am not studying or working, I am
              typically working on personal projects, such as Unity games, or
              enjoying one of many hobbies, such as watching movies, reading a
              book, practicing guitar, etc.
